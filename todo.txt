Keep user's TZ up to date
Add repeat on certain weekdays functionality
Make repeat interval prepopulate when editing task
Make redirect back to correct page after marking task done
Add a way to postpone tasks

Algorithm improvements:
	"Fill in" time remaining after reducing load.  Start with shortest high priority tasks and work up to longest hp tasks, then short mp to long mp, etc.
	does stable topological sort exist???
