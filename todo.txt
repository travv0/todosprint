Make sure repeating task goes off of user day and not UTC day
Fix time wrapping when UTC is the next day from user
Add repeat on certain weekdays functionality
Make repeat interval prepopulate when editing task
Make redirect back to correct page after marking task done
Add a way to postpone tasks
Make look pretty

Algorithm improvements:
	"Fill in" time remaining after reducing load.  Start with shortest high priority tasks and work up to longest hp tasks, then short mp to long mp, etc.
	does stable topological sort exist???
